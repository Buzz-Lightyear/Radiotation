      <h1>Here's how it works</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Log in below.</li>
        <li>Players have icons indicating stuff about them, hover over them to see what they mean.</li>
        <li>Each round will begin with a normal round of Texas Hold 'Em, where you can do shit like bet, fold, check, call, and all that other good stuff.</li>
        <li>The winner(s) of the round will be dealt a card from their hand or the community cards, that becomes their card in Kings (Rules to the right)</li>
        <li>There's also a chug option that gets more likely every round, you'll know it when you see it.</li>
        <li>When we're all sick of the game or everyone is out, we stop playing, and the person with the most money/last Airbender&trade; gets $250, cash.</li>
        <li>If Pat Coffey wins, he gets nothing because he's 2,500 miles away.</li>
